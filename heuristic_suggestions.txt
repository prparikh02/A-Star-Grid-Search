Euclidean Distance
Manhattan Distance
Diagonal Distance

Came upon this one accidentally (had a bug in the code, but it actually seems to work better than Euclidean):
	h = ((x - goal_x)^2 + (y - start_y)^2)
	or
	h = ((x - start_x)^2 + (y - start_y)^2)
	or
	any variant of using distances from BOTH goal and start

Note: Keep scales of h and g close, otherwise f will be weighted too much one way or another
